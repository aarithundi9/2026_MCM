FINAL RECOMMENDATION: VOTING METHOD COMPARISON
MCM Problem C 2026
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
─────────────────
There is NO universally "best" method. The optimal choice depends on 
the show's priorities:

1. IF SKILL MATTERS MOST:
   → Recommend: RANK_B2
   This method best aligns outcomes with judge assessments.

2. IF FAN ENGAGEMENT MATTERS MOST:
   → Recommend: RANK_B2
   This method gives fans the most meaningful voting power.

3. IF BALANCED APPROACH:
   → Recommend: RANK_B2
   Best trade-off between skill recognition and fan power.

4. IF AVOIDING CONTROVERSY MATTERS MOST:
   → Recommend: RANK_B2
   Minimizes outcomes that differ drastically from judge rankings.


KEY INSIGHTS
────────────
1. RANK METHOD:
   • Makes it EASIER for underdogs to survive (equal weight to fan rank)
   • More sensitive to ties and small vote differences
   • Used in S1-2 and brought back in S28+ with judges-choose-bottom-2

2. PERCENT METHOD:
   • Proportional representation - big fan leads translate directly
   • Can create "fan favorite" dominance over skill
   • Used S3-27, including controversial Bristol Palin/Bobby Bones seasons

3. RANK + JUDGES BOTTOM 2 (S28+):
   • Hybrid approach balancing fan power with judge override
   • Judges can "save" skilled dancers from pure popularity voting
   • Represents show's CURRENT solution to the controversy problem


UNCERTAINTY ACKNOWLEDGMENT
──────────────────────────
• Our fan vote estimates have inherent uncertainty (±20-30%)
• Bootstrap CIs show recommendations are statistically robust but not certain
• Historical seasons used different voting rules we cannot fully reconstruct
• "Controversial" is subjective - some viewers LIKE underdogs winning


WHY THE SHOW CHANGED METHODS
────────────────────────────
The show's own evolution tells the story:
• S1-2: Started with RANK (simple, intuitive)
• S3-27: Switched to PERCENT (more "democratic")
• S28+: Returned to RANK + added B2 rule

The S28 change was likely a response to controversial outcomes like:
• Bristol Palin (S11): 3rd place despite consistently last in judges
• Bobby Bones (S27): WINNER despite low judge scores

The current RANK+B2 system is the show's attempt at a "best of both worlds"
solution: fans still have meaningful power, but judges get a final say
on close calls.


OUR PREFERENCE
──────────────
If forced to choose ONE method for ALL seasons:

→ RANK + JUDGES BOTTOM 2 (the current S28+ method)

Rationale:
• Preserves fan engagement (fans still determine most eliminations)
• Adds skill correction mechanism (judges can save skilled dancers)
• Reduces but doesn't eliminate "underdog" narratives
• Already validated by 7 seasons of use (S28-34)

Confidence: MODERATE (70%)
The data supports this choice, but the 95% CIs overlap for many metrics.

# 🎯 MCM PROBLEM C - 30-SECOND SUMMARY

## Where You Started
Question: "How should DWTS combine judge and fan votes?"

## What You Built (Steps 1-10)
1. **Data Foundation** - DWTS dataset + Instagram followers
2. **Predictive Model** - 88.63% accuracy (R²)
3. **Fan Vote Estimation** - 80% accuracy predicting eliminations
4. **Method Comparison** - Rank vs Percentage analysis
5. **Ready for:** Controversial cases, pro dancer analysis, final report

## The Finding
- **Judges reward skill** (coefficient: -3.5963, p < 0.001)
- **Fans reward fame** (Instagram followers matter, p = 0.0118)  
- **Systems matter** (Rank vs Percentage produce different outcomes 15-20% of time)
- **Controversial cases prove it** (Bobby Bones won, Bristol Palin made finals despite low judges)

## What's Next
- Step 11: Analyze 4 controversial cases (3 hours)
- Step 12: Pro dancer effects (4 hours)
- Step 13: Propose better voting system (3 hours)
- Step 14: Write final report + memo (4 hours)
